# Go Trainer with Cognitive Load Theory

An interactive command-line trainer for learning Go programming fundamentals, built using proven learning science principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT).

## Features

- **Worked Examples First** - Study complete solutions before practicing
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Complex concepts broken into manageable chunks  
- **Multiple Practice Challenges** - Faded guidance from scaffolded to independent
- **Adaptive Feedback** - Context-aware hints and support
- **Learning Analytics** - Track time, attempts, and progress

## Cognitive Load Theory Principles Applied

### ðŸ§  Intrinsic Load Management
- Prerequisites clearly defined
- Single learning objective per exercise
- Concepts introduced in logical progression

### ðŸŽ¯ Extraneous Load Reduction  
- Clean, consistent interface
- Clear learning goals stated upfront
- Minimal cognitive distractions

### ðŸ’¡ Germane Load Optimization
- Worked examples demonstrate patterns
- Multiple contexts for same concept
- Elaborative feedback reinforces learning

## Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Types** - Master Go's variable declarations and type system
2. **Functions** - Learn to create and use functions effectively

## Usage

```bash
go run cmd/trainer/main.go
```

## Commands

- `help` - Show available commands
- `hint` - Get step-by-step guidance
- `skip` - Skip current challenge and see solution
- `quit` - Exit the trainer

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
go test
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:
```bash
go test -bench=.
```

Run specific test:
```bash
go test -run TestVariablesValidator
```
