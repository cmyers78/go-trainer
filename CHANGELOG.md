## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üß† Major: Cognitive Load Theory Implementation

This release represents a complete transformation of the Go trainer from a basic quiz application into a scientifically-backed learning platform using Cognitive Load Theory principles.

#### Added
- **Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) Architecture**
  - Worked example effect: Complete solutions shown before practice
  - Progressive disclosure: Complex concepts broken into manageable chunks
  - Completion effect: Structured templates with scaffolding
  - Faded guidance: Decreasing support across multiple challenges
  - Variability effect: Same concepts in different contexts

- **Enhanced Learning Design**
  - Multiple worked examples per topic (4 examples per exercise)
  - Progressive challenge difficulty (3 challenges per exercise)
  - Step-by-step hints with adaptive feedback
  - Learning goals clearly stated for each exercise
  - Prerequisites tracking and display
  - Estimated time for each exercise

- **Comprehensive Learning Analytics**
  - CLT-informed scoring algorithm considering:
    - Base completion score (60 points)
    - Efficiency bonus (up to 30 points for fewer attempts)
    - Hint penalty (2 points per hint, max 10 point penalty)
    - Speed bonus (up to 10 points for fast completion)
  - Real-time progress tracking across exercises
  - Individual and average score reporting
  - Attempt and hint usage analytics
  - Time tracking per exercise and overall session

- **Professional Terminal Interface**
  - Unicode box borders for code blocks (replacing Markdown fences)
  - Consistent visual formatting throughout
  - Clean, distraction-free learning environment
  - Terminal-optimized code presentation

- **Modular Architecture**
  - Clean separation into `cmd/`, `internal/`, and `tests/` directories
  - Exercise registry pattern for extensible content management
  - Proper Go module structure with `github.com/cmyers78/go-trainer`
  - Type-safe models with CLT-specific fields (cognitive level, exercise type)

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit tests for all components with CLT principle validation
  - Performance benchmarks for core functions
  - Test organization by type (unit, integration, benchmark)
  - Progress tracking and scoring functionality tests

#### Changed
- **Complete Architecture Refactor**
  - Moved from single-file to modular package structure
  - Separated concerns: models, exercises, trainer logic
  - Implemented proper Go conventions and best practices
  - Enhanced error handling and type safety

- **Exercise Content Enhancement**
  - Expanded from basic examples to comprehensive learning modules
  - Added detailed explanations and multiple contexts per concept
  - Implemented progressive difficulty across challenges
  - Enhanced validation logic for more accurate feedback

- **User Experience Improvements**
  - Replaced basic text output with professionally formatted displays
  - Added adaptive feedback based on performance patterns
  - Implemented context-aware hints and guidance
  - Enhanced completion feedback with motivational elements

#### Removed
- **Dead Code Cleanup**
  - Removed unused `CognitivePrinciples` utility class
  - Eliminated redundant `models.Trainer` struct (kept `CLTTrainer`)
  - Cleaned up empty directories and unused imports
  - Removed Markdown formatting in favor of terminal-native display

#### Fixed
- **Progress Tracking Bug**
  - Fixed attempts/hints aggregation across multiple challenges per exercise
  - Proper separation between challenge-level and exercise-level tracking
  - Ensured all `LearningProgress` fields are properly initialized and updated

- **Analytics Implementation**
  - Completed scoring algorithm implementation
  - Fixed real-time progress updates during learning sessions
  - Ensured comprehensive learning analytics in final results

- **Terminal Formatting Issues**
  - Replaced problematic Markdown fences with Unicode borders
  - Consistent code block presentation across all examples
  - Professional appearance in terminal environments

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements

#### Architecture
- **Package Structure**: Follows Go best practices with clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency Management**: Proper internal packages and clean imports
- **Extensibility**: Registry pattern allows easy addition of new exercises
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type definitions with CLT-specific fields

#### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: All GitHub Copilot feedback addressed
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and benchmark tests
- **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and architectural decisions
- **Performance**: Benchmarked core functions for optimization

#### Development Workflow
- **Feature Branches**: Proper Git workflow with feature branches and PRs
- **Code Review**: GitHub PR process with automated and manual review
- **Continuous Integration**: Test validation on all changes
- **Change Management**: Structured commit messages and change tracking

### üìö Learning Science Foundation

This release is built on established CLT research:
- **Worked Example Effect** (Sweller & Cooper, 1985)
- **Progressive Disclosure** (Pollock et al., 2002)  
- **Completion Effect** (Van Merri√´nboer & Krammer, 1990)
- **Variability Effect** (Paas & Van Merri√´nboer, 1994)

### üöÄ Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v1.x:

1. **New Command**: Use `go run cmd/trainer/main.go` instead of `go run .`
2. **Enhanced Experience**: Expect richer learning content with examples and analytics
3. **New Features**: Scoring, progress tracking, and adaptive feedback now available
4. **Terminal Output**: Improved formatting with professional code block display

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX
